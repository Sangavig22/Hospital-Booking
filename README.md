## 📌 Overview  

**HealthSync** is a full-stack hospital appointment web application built to simplify how patients connect with hospitals and doctors.  

We got this idea after realizing how challenging it can be to book appointments — having to call customer care to check doctor availability, remember appointment times, or reschedule bookings.  

💡 **Our Solution:**  
HealthSync provides a single online platform where users can:  
- View doctor availability, specialization, experience, and fees  
- Create an account (sign up/login) before booking appointments  
- Book, reschedule, and manage appointments online  
- Explore hospital background, mission, and values  
- View featured doctors and available hospital services  
- Send direct messages to hospitals for inquiries  
- Access personalized features like:  
  - 🗓️ **My Appointments** – view past and upcoming bookings  
  - 👤 **My Profile** – edit and update personal details anytime
